### [WC Password Strength Settings](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wc*password*strength*settings/#reviews)
#### **Project: Password strength**
#### Description: Weaken the password strength requirement
This plugin allows you to choose between four password levels, as well as remove the password hint.
Settings
Go to `Woocommerce > Accounts`, and at the bottom of the page will be "User Password Strength Settings". The strength requirement is currently set at `Level 2 - Weak`, while the messages and the other settings have been left the same. 
### [WooCommerce Photo Reviews](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo*photo*reviews/)
#### Project: Adding pictures to user reviews
Description: Allow users to upload images and add them to their reviews
This plugin allows customers to post reviews that include photos. The settings to this plugins include: reviews must include photos, photo review style, photo options (max photo size), filter reviews, etc.
### [Woocommerce Product Archive Customiser](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-product-archive-customiser/)
#### **Issue: Browse Closet page displaying 4 columns instead of 3**
I used this plugin to set the number of columns displayed to 3 columns. This plugin inserts a `Products Archive` tab into `Appearance > Customize`.
Settings
* Product Columns: 3
* Products per page: 24
* Checked display product count, display add to cart buttons, display product image, and display stock
##### Possible conflicts:
According to the plugin website, it's only been tested up to Woocommerce version 4.7.9, and was last updated at least a year ago. I believe it is still compatible with the current version of WooCommerce and will continue to be compatible.
Another issue is that I want to download the YITH Infinite Scrolling plugin so that there's no limit on products per page. However, the Product Archive Customiser plugin sets the max number of products per page to 24, so I'm worried that they might conflict. Best case is that the YITH Infinite Scrolling plugin overrides the Product Archive Customiser plugin.
### [YITH Infinite Scrolling](https://wordpress.org/plugins/yith-infinite-scrolling/#reviews)
#### **Allows infinite scrolling in the Browse Closet page**
General Settings
* Enable infinite scrolling - on
* Navigation Selector: `.woocommerce-pagination`
* Next Selector: `.woocommerce-pagination a.next`
* Item Selector: `.div.product`
* Content Selector: `div.products-list`
### [WooCommerce Remove Product Sorting](https://www.skyverge.com/product/woocommerce-remove-product-sorting/)
#### **DEACTIVATED**
#### **Removes default Woocommerce AJAX sorting from product pages**
Able to select which sorting options to remove under `Appearance > Customize > WooCommerce > Product Catalog`
CSS in `Appearance > Customize` made plugin redundant
```
div.before-products-list.rounded-corners.clearfix
{
display: none;
}
```
## Code
### Customizer
#### Description: adjust CSS to make the site more aesthetically pleasing, correct styling issues, etc.
Code is stored in `customizer.css`
### Project: Checkout with images
#### Description: insert product images in product tables during checkout
#### Solution
Modify the `review-order.php` file (but don't change the original file in the woocommerce plugin) and update the new version into `theme/woocommerce/checkout` <br />
Place this code:
```php
<?php $thumbnail = apply_filters( 'woocommerce_in_cart_product_thumbnail', $_product->get_image(), $values, $cart_item_key ); echo $thumbnail; ?>
```
before the following line of code in `review-order.php`
```php
<?php echo apply_filters( 'woocommerce_cart_item_name', $_product->get_name(), $cart_item, $cart_item_key ) . '&nbsp;'; ?>
```
### Project: Order confirmation email with images
#### Description: insert product images in email order confirmation
#### Solution
Modify the `email*order*details.php` located in `plugins/woocommerce/templates/emails` (but don't change the original file in the woocommerce plugin) and insert the new version into `theme/woocommerce/emails` <br />
Change this code:
```php
'show_image' => false
```
to
```php
'show_image' => true
```
The whole code snippet:
```php
<tbody>
    <?php echo wc_get_email_order_items( $order, array( // WPCS: XSS ok.
        'show_sku'      => $sent_to_admin,
        'show_image'    => true,
        'image_size'    => array( 32, 32 ),
        'plain_text'    => $plain_text,
        'sent_to_admin' => $sent_to_admin,
    ) );
    ?>
</tbody>
```
